# Automated Drone System for Apple Disease Detection

## Overview

The Automated Drone System for Apple Disease Detection is a precision agriculture solution developed to monitor apple orchards and detect diseases at an early stage using drone-based aerial imaging and machine learning. The system automates drone flights to collect visual data and uses a trained AI model to analyze the condition of apple trees for disease symptoms.

## Features

- Autonomous drone flight across predefined orchard zones
- Real-time image and video capture
- AI-driven detection of apple diseases using aerial imagery
- Visual reporting of affected areas to assist decision-making
- Scalable design for varying orchard sizes and conditions

## How It Works

1. A drone autonomously flies over the apple orchard, capturing images and videos.
2. The collected visuals are processed through a trained machine learning model.
3. The model identifies visible signs of disease in apple trees.
4. The results are used to generate a visual report for analysis and intervention.
